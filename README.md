# Placeholder Data

This repo leverages [My JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/) to create a mock API so that custom component authors can follow sample component tutorials and interact with a "real" data.

You should be able to perform the following actions against this mock API:

- GET https://my-json-server.typicode.com/prismatic-io/placeholder-data/items - Get all items in the inventory.
- POST https://my-json-server.typicode.com/prismatic-io/placeholder-data/items - "Add" a new item to inventory.
- GET https://my-json-server.typicode.com/prismatic-io/placeholder-data/items/1 - Get a specific item from inventory by ID.
- DELETE https://my-json-server.typicode.com/prismatic-io/placeholder-data/items/1 - "Delete" an item from inventory by ID.
